# Smoothie üç¶‚õ∏üç®‚ùÑ
Simple way to handle the Idling Resource in your Espresso tests. 

# Download

## Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```Groovy
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
    
## Add the dependency

```Groovy
	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.stavro96:smoothie:1.0'
	}
```

# Usage: 

## In your class where you have some async operation: 

To increment: 

```Kotlin
Smoothie.startProcess()
```
To decrement: 

```Kotlin
Smoothie.endProcess()
```
In your Espresso test: 

```Kotlin
    @Before
    fun setUp() {
        IdlingRegistry.getInstance().register(Smoothie.countingIdlingResource)
        //other dependencies
    }

    @After
    fun tearDown() {
        IdlingRegistry.getInstance().unregister(Smoothie.countingIdlingResource)
        print("Finished testing")
    }
```

Note: The library supports the latest version for Idling-Resources with the AndroidX usage: 
```Groovy
    implementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-idling-resource:3.2.0'
```
And we are good to go.
